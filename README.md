#MoneyLeak


If you're like me, you might have made several email accounts for those "Free Trials" that Amazon Prime or Netflix have. If you're even MORE like me, you forget about these all the time, until you get charged on your card that you needed to input to get that trial...

Introducing MoneyLeak, the fullstop shop for all your money leakage. Download a CSV of your bank statement and run it through MoneyLeak. Not only will it track which payments keep showing up, it will set them all in a file and send you reminders on your main email that you need to 
cancel that subscription before you get charged!
